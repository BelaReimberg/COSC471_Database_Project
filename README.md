## COSC471_Database_Project
- This project consists of a web application that works with a database that contains customer, employee and rental information.
- The goal of this project was understanding the architecturing process of a database from the business objective analysis to the final stage where the database is finaly implemented, and can be used for insertion, deletion and lookup.
- A conceptual data model was built in order to plan for implementation using Entity-Relation Diagrams.
- Process files contain php code and queries for verification and retrieval of information from the car_rental databse. 
- Since the main goal of the project was to focus on the design and integrity of the database, I did not invest as much time on CSS for this particular project.The CSS design of the pages was borrowed from https://simplecss.org/ which offered a free css stylesheet for non-comercial uses.
