# COSC471_Database_Project
This project consists of a web application that works with a database that contains customer, employee and rental information.
Connection through the line require_once connect.php (connect.php has connection procedures) was not working in the project, so connection code was included in each file that needed it and it is marked by comments. Process files contain php code and queries for verification and retrieval of information from the car_rental databse. 
The design of the database was borrowed from https://simplecss.org/ which offered a free css stylesheet for general uses.
